# _Galactic Age Calculator_

#### _Calculate solar years on different planets, 11.15.19_

#### By _**Will Quanstrom**_

## Description

_The webpage takes a user's input and uses it to calculate their life expectancy on earth. Then, it translates that to the different lengths of time a solar year takes on planets in our solar system_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone repository on github_
* _Install node modules_
* _Open in browser_
* _Input data in form fields and press submit_
* _Program will output data_


_My specs when developing this project go as follows: The user inputs their age and other data about their living situation -- Data is used to calculate user's life expectancy -- Their life expectancy as well as an approximation of how many years left they have to live appears -- The number of solar years they would have lived if they spent their life on other planets, and the approx. amount of time they have left, appears under pictures of appropriate planets. _
